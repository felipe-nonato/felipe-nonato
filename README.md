### Hello, world. I'm Luís Felipe Ferreira 👋

> "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." – Leonardo da Vinci

I craft **scalable**, **data-driven** solutions with a strong focus on clarity, performance, and long-term maintainability.  
From backend logic with **Node.js** to sleek UIs in **React/Next.js**, and data pipelines in **Python + Pandas**,  
I turn complexity into clean architecture — and ideas into working software.
